v 0.3.5
- introduced send/receive-groups to send/receive commands from specific relatives

v 0.3.4
- added an asMarker class to highlight image regions
- added buttons to the asStatistics class to mark the max and min pixels
- added option to change the increment of the valueChanger
- new YlGnBu colormap from the matplotlib, added by Christian Holme
- changed cell2imageMat method to zerofill empty cells
- fixed image-export methods to work with matlab 2014b
- fixed some more matlab 2014b compatibility issues

v 0.3.3
- wrote a workaround for the sometimes 'jammed' mouse dragging
- exchanged getFigureHandle by getFigureNumber in some scripts 
  (eg. the algebra functions in asBrowse) for matlab 2014b compatibility
- replaced initial data check with error handling for nans and infs (improving startup time for large data arrays)

v 0.3.2
- added option to crop images from zoom
- added option to add an offset to the value changer
- allowed to export colorbars in other filtypes than just eps
- fixed a bug resulting from exchanging str2num with str2double
- deactivated the handle visibility of the cursor rectangle again for all 
    matlab versions < 2014b since the 2014b workarounds can still cause problems 
    e.g. when dragging ROIs.

v 0.3.1
- created another workaround for an error due to the changed uistack in matlab 2014b
- created a workaround in asBrowse to compensate for table displacements in matlab 2014b

v 0.3.0
- matlab 2014b support
- fixed bug in asCursorPosition class showing radiants instead of degrees
- added reshape operation
- minor changes and bug fixes

v 0.2.3
- added option to export images to a movie file

v 0.2.2
- fixed a bug that made the absolute window potentially change when scrolling through images with highly different dynamics
- fixed a bug that sometimes activated dragging mode when opening the context menu

v.0.2.1
- added mouse zooming (strg+mouseWheel)
- added mouse dragging (shift the image in the FOV)
- added option to derive slider limits from percentile of the image (rather that from min and max). This helps windowing noisy data.
- improved the layout and readability of the cursorPosition class to work better in small windows
- improved automatic precision selection for the center/width text in the imageWindowing class
- made the asIconClass a singleton class such that icons only need to be read from disc once
- added modifier (shift, ctrl,...) to several buttons, e.g. to send the zoom, toggle the plot dim etc.
- added html tooltips to the most important control panels
- added an option to continously play along a plot dimension
- plot dimensions can now be selected by ctrl + click
- added cropDim functionality to the valueChanger

v.0.2
- started a rudimentary changelog :)
- fixed bug where manually entered min and max values for the windowing might not have been "force set" to the slider
- added workaround to help preventing asObjects from dying after saving them to a file
- added support for interleavedComplex data
- automatically add a semicolon to destructive selection strings, if missing
- changed shortcut for fftshift2 to 'ctrl + shift + f'
- added crop operation
- added algebra operation scripts
- added algebra operations to asBrowse
- added a setZoom menu with standard zoom levels (1,2,3,4)
- added zoom shortcuts (Ctrl + 1, 2, ...)
